# Image Stitching System Rules

Rules and requirements for the UAV image stitching system used in drone competitions.

<rule>
name: image_stitching_requirements
description: Core requirements and constraints for the image stitching system

metadata:
  competition: true
  version: 1.0
  priority: high

# Core System Requirements
requirements:
  image_format:
    - All images must be 1920x1080 pixels (KING_SIZE)
    - Input images that don't match this size must be resized
    - Original aspect ratio should be maintained when possible
  
  grid_structure:
    - Images are taken in a 4x3 grid pattern
    - Known overlap between adjacent images:
      - Horizontal: 3% of image width
      - Vertical: 6% of image height
    - Grid structure must be maintained in final output

  alignment:
    - No IMU/orientation data available for alignment
    - Rough north alignment from compass (±5° accuracy)
    - Must handle rotations up to ±5° between adjacent images
    - Must handle slight zoom variations between images

# Technical Constraints
constraints:
  sift_matching:
    - Uses SIFT for feature detection and matching
    - Must handle both horizontal and vertical stitching
    - Should account for potential rotational differences
    - Must be robust against false matches, especially on y-axis
    - Should maintain grid structure while allowing for minor adjustments

  overlap_handling:
    - Horizontal overlap: 3% of KING_SIZE width
    - Vertical overlap: 6% of KING_SIZE height
    - Must handle slight variations in overlap amount
    - Should detect and reject invalid matches

  error_handling:
    - Must have fallback mechanisms when matching fails
    - Should log/visualize matching results for debugging
    - Should handle edge cases gracefully

# Test Cases
test_scenarios:
  basic:
    - Perfect alignment case (current working scenario)
    - Same size, zoom level, and alignment
    - Clean overlap regions
  
  advanced:
    - Rotated images (±5°)
    - Slight zoom variations
    - Variable lighting conditions
    - Real runway test images

# Future Enhancements
planned_improvements:
  - Enhanced SIFT matching with better outlier detection
  - RANSAC-based transformation estimation
  - Two-phase matching system
  - Improved debug visualizations

examples:
  - scenario: "Perfect Alignment"
    description: "Current working case with aligned images"
    expected: "Clean stitching with minimal artifacts"
  
  - scenario: "Rotated Images"
    description: "Images with ±5° rotation"
    expected: "Correct alignment and stitching despite rotation"
